# tobochs
An attempt to redo http://gunkies.org/wiki/Installing_386BSD_on_BOCHS
That guide was made in 2010 for a manual install on an AWS Fedora Core 8 box.

This is going to run fully automated on a Travis CI Trusty box.
See https://travis-ci.org/dugoh/tobochs for the latest build.

It is nowhere near done.
