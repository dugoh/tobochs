# tobochs
An attempt to redo http://gunkies.org/wiki/Installing_386BSD_on_BOCHS
The guide was made in 2010 for a manual install on an AWS Fedora Core 8 box.

This is an attempt to do a fully automated reproducible build on a Travis CI Ubuntu Trusty box.

See https://travis-ci.org/dugoh/tobochs for the latest attempt.

The build is hit and miss for now as Tiny 386BSD freezes up most of the time when downloading the full distribution.
